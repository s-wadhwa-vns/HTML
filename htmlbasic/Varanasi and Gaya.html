        Nomenclature of Gaya is based on the myth of demon Gayasur who Lord Vishnu had killed in a dual. The place is so
        sacred for Hindus that even Lord Ram had performed Pindadanam here for his ancestors. Legend says that Lord Ram
        had come to Gaya to pay homage to his ancestors and Sita had accompanied him on his way.</h2>
