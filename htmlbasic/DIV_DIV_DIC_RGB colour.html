        INTRODUCTION - Varanasi is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities. Kashi, its ancient name,
        was associated with a kingdom of the same name of 2,500 years ago. The Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to
        have given his first sermon, "The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma", at nearby Sarnath in 528 BCE. In
        the 8th century, Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi. Since ancient
        times, the city has been an important centre of Hindu devotion, pilgrimage, mysticism and poetry contributing to
        its cultural importance. Tulsidas wrote his Awadhi language epic, the Ramcharitmanas, a Bhakti movement
        reworking of the Sanskrit Ramayana, in Varanasi. Several other major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in
        Varanasi, including Kabir and Ravidas. In the 16th century, Rajput nobles in the service of the courts and
        armies of the Mughal emperor Akbar, sponsored the building or further enhancement of the major Shiva temple in
        the city; they also built other temples, all displaying an empire-wide architectural style. Under the
        Treaty of Faizabad, the East India Company acquired Benares in 1775, the city later successively
        becoming a part of the Benares Division in the Ceded and Conquered Provinces, the North-Western Provinces, and
        the United Provinces, and after India's independence of Uttar Pradesh.

            ANCIENT PERIOD - xcavations in 2014 led to the discovery of artefacts dating back to 800 BCE. Further
            excavations at Aktha
            and Ramnagar, two sites in the vicinity of the city, unearthed artefacts dating back to 1800 BCE, supporting
            the view that the area was inhabited by this time.
            Varanasi grew as an important industrial centre, famous for its muslin and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory
            works, and sculpture. During the time of Gautama Buddha, Varanasi was part of the Kingdom of Kashi.
            The Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon, "The
            Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma", at nearby Sarnath. The celebrated Chinese traveller
            Xuanzang, also known as Hiuen Tsiang, who visited the city around 635 CE, attested that the city was a
            centre of religious and artistic activities, and that it extended for about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) along the
            western bank of the Ganges. When Xuanzang, visited Varanasi in the 7th century, he named it
            "Polonise" (婆羅痆斯) and wrote that the city had some 30 temples with about 30 monks. The city's religious
            importance continued to grow in the 8th century, when Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an
            official sect of Varanasi.

                MEDIVAL PERIOD -  Kabir, a 15th-century Indian mystic poet and saint
                Chandradeva, founder of the Gahadavala dynasty made Banaras a second capital in 1090. In 1194 CE,
                the Ghurid conqueror Muizzuddin Muhammad Ghuri defeated the forces of Jayachandra in a battle near
                Jamuna and afterwards ravaged the city of Varnasi incourse of which many temples were destroyed.
                Varanasi remained a centre of activity for intellectuals and theologians during the Middle Ages, which
                further contributed to its reputation as a cultural centre of religion and education. Several major
                figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including Kabir who was born here in 1389, and
                Ravidas, a 15th-century socio-religious reformer, mystic, poet, traveller, and spiritual figure, who was
                born and lived in the city and employed in the tannery industry.
