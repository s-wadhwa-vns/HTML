    <h2 id="UP">UTTAR PRADESH <br></h2>
      <p>  Embedded in the heart of India is Uttar Pradesh, a land where cultures have evolved and
        religions converge. The greatness of Uttar Pradesh lies not only in this confluence, but also in the emergence
        of cultural and religious traditions along some of the greatest rivers in the Indian sub-continent â€“ the Ganga
        and the Yamuna. Throughout history, great cities have emerged and established along great rivers. Within India,
        the Ganga and the Yamuna have nurtured a culture because of which religious faith, rituals, culture and
        intellectual enlightenment have evolved in places along the two rivers</p>

    <h2 id="BH">BIHAR <br></h2>
       <p> Bihar is a state in East India, bordering Nepal. It is divided by the River Ganges, which floods its fertile
        plains. Important Buddhist pilgrimage sites include the Bodhi Tree in Bodhgaya's Mahabodhi Temple, under which
        the Buddha allegedly meditated. In the state capital Patna, Mahavir Mandir temple is revered by Hindus, while
        Sikhs worship at the domed, riverside Gurdwara of Takht Sri Harmandir Sahib Ji.</p>
